# Leak

The unauthorized or unintentional exposure of a secret. Exposing
non-sensitive data is not a leak.

## Examples

### Leaks

* A database of user credentials posted on a public forum.
* SSH private key pushed to a public git repo
* Customer data posted into another customer's support ticket

### Not Leaks

* A publicly shared, _unused_ SSH key pair created _only_ for a tutorial
