# Secret
Any piece of sensitive information that, if exposed, could pose a
risk to an individual or organization. The sensitivity of a secret is highly
contextual.

## Examples

* High Impact: Private signing key for software releases
* Contextual: Email address (e.g. in private employee list vs on a personal blog)
